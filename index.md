# PYTHON!

## Your First Python Program
For your first Python program, we will be creating a hello world program, which is a popular first step in learning a new language.
Enter this code into your python file:
```python
print("Hello World!")
```
This code outputs:
```
Hello World
```
The print statement is how we output text in Python. You must surround the text in quotes, if you are not using a variable. Numbers do not need quotes.

```python
print("I am 12 years old")
print(12)
```
